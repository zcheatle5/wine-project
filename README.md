## Introduction
- A big deal in the wine industry is that wine growers and viticulturalists had have trouble producing certain grapes for wine due to the changes in weather. With the shifting of the seasons, grape vine and many other perennials have had their natural growth cycles thrown off by warmer weather and drastic temperature fluctuations. Warmer weather typically means spring so grape vines come out of dormancy, but if it gets cold again, they don’t make it.
- California hosts some of the world's largest wine companies and it produces 90 percent of American-made wine. It also supplies more than 60 percent of all wine consumed in the country.
- In this project, we took a look at the yearly grape yield of California by grape varietal and county, then compared it with yearly and monthly temperatures, precipitation, and ozone levels. We also did an analysis of temperature and precipitation on the month of January for dormant season. Finally, we used Scikit-Learn machine learning library’s linear regression model to predict the wine grape production for the future.
